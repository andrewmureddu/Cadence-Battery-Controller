# Cadence Battery Controller (Embodiment of the Cadence Control Law)

This repository documents the **application of the Cadence Control Law (CCL)** to energy storage and retrieval systems.  
Specifically, it covers **multi-chemistry and hybrid ensembles** (e.g., LFP, NMC, LTO, ultracapacitors, flywheels) managed under a **cadence-based controller** that rotates roles of bulk, alignment, and sprinter modules.
